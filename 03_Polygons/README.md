# Day 3: Polygons

I plotted zoning, year of last renovation (or year of construction), and land value per square meter in my home alcaldía (Iztapalapa) in Mexico City.

I used Mexico City's Open Geographic Information System.

To properly replicate the maps, you have to decompress the two zip files included in `03_Polygons/Data`. You should have a directory named `SHP` and a file named `sig_IZTAPALAPA.csv` after decompression.
