Hi! My name is Pablo and here are my contributions to the [#30DayMapChallenge](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge).

Feedback is very welcome via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_egbg_).

## Day 1: [Points](https://github.com/pablorm296/30DayMapChallenge/tree/master/01_Points)

I plotted all bars, pubs, and [pulquerías](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulque) in Mexico City —my home town. I used INEGI's DENUE (the National Directory of Economic Entities) and OpenStreetMap (for the road layout).

Maybe not all bar, pubs, and pulquerías in Mexico City are actually plotted here, since I found some errors in the database, but I did my best.

## Day 2: [Lines](https://github.com/pablorm296/30DayMapChallenge/tree/master/02_Lines)

I plotted commuting links made inside Mexico City using exclusively three means of transport: bicycle, subway, and car.

I used data from the INEGI's Origin-Destination survey (2017) and OpenStreetMap —for the road layout.

## Day 3: [Polygons](https://github.com/pablorm296/30DayMapChallenge/tree/master/02_Polygons)

I plotted zoning, year of last renovation (or year of construction), and land value per square meter in my home alcaldía (Iztapalapa) in Mexico City.

I used Mexico City's Open Geographic Information System.
