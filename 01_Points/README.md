# Day 1: Points

I plotted all bars, pubs, and [pulquerías](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulque) in Mexico City —my home town. I used INEGI's DENUE (the National Directory of Economic Entities) and OpenStreetMap (for the road layout).

Maybe not all bar, pubs, and pulquerías in Mexico City are actually plotted here, since I found some errors in the database, but I did my best.

To properly replicate the maps, I included a compressed version of the data needed in `01_Points/Data/denue_inegi_09.zip`. When uncompressed, you should get a .csv file named `denue_inegi_09.csv`.
